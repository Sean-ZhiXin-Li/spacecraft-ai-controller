# Project Log – Day 25

## Overview
Today’s focus was on refining the PPO training pipeline for the spacecraft orbit control task.  
We integrated additional logging requirements for:
- **Loss log** (`loss_log.csv`)
- **Reward curve plotting**
- **Model checkpoints** (`ppo_epoch_800.pth`)
- **Orbit visualization** (via `evaluate` script after training)

## Key Actions
1. Reviewed the training script to ensure compatibility with pre-selected base checkpoint loading.
2. Updated file output pipeline to store:
   - Training logs (loss, reward per epoch)
   - Model parameters at the final epoch
   - Post-training orbit plots for performance evaluation
3. Confirmed the training run configuration:
   - **Epochs:** 800
   - **PPO Hyperparameters:** unchanged for stability testing
   - **Initial model state:** Loaded from selected merged checkpoint
4. Added console feedback and ensured per-epoch progress printouts.

## Issues Encountered
- **Long runtime without console output:**  
  Training initially showed no visible output for over 2 hours due to evaluation/print frequency settings. This caused uncertainty about progress.
- **Unclear KL-adaptive logic placement:**  
  The KL-divergence-based training iteration adjustment snippet was not yet integrated, pending clarity on exact location inside the loop.
- **Potential environment bottlenecks:**  
  Reward computation speed is potentially a limiting factor when running long 800-epoch training cycles.

## Current Status
- Training **is ongoing** with the merged checkpoint as the initialization point.
- Model outputs and logs will be generated after the 800th epoch.
- No evaluation results yet, as run is still in progress.
