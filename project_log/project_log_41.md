# Day 41 Project Log

**Date:** 2025-08-25  
**Status:** Transition into consolidation phase (less new content, more testing & refactoring).

---

## Activities
- Officially started Day 41 after class; entered the phase of not writing large amounts of new content.
- Worked on environment packaging issues:
  - Added `__init__.py` to `envs/`, `controller/`, and `Tests/` directories.
  - Created `conftest.py` to ensure root path resolution during pytest collection.
- Adjusted `controller/combined_controller.py`:
  - Unified `Controller` class.
  - Added compatibility aliases `smart_combined_controller` and `combined_controller` to match older tests.
  - Implemented a flexible wrapper so tests can call `smart_combined_controller` both as a function and as a class-based instance.
- Ran `pytest` multiple times to debug import errors and signature mismatches.
  - Fixed `ImportError` issues for `envs` and `controller`.
  - Fixed `TypeError` caused by incorrect mapping of `Controller` to `smart_combined_controller`.
- Verified test execution; only `test_env_step_smoke` still needs re-alignment with the current `MultiOrbitEnv` constructor.

## Observations
- The orbit debug plots (trajectory vs. target orbit and radius vs. time) show that the ExpertController and combined setup are producing valid trajectories.
- With noise enabled, radial error increases but remains close to the no-noise case, indicating robustness of the controller.
- `pytest` still triggers many matplotlib warnings related to Tk backend, but they do not affect numerical results.

## Issues Encountered
- **Module imports:** Required explicit `__init__.py` files and root path injection.
- **Legacy test expectations:** `smart_combined_controller` in robustness tests expected a functional API, not a bare class. Solved with a wrapper.
- **Smoke test mismatch:** `MultiOrbitEnv` requires `base_env` and `task_sampler`, but the current test only provided `SimConfig`.

## Next Steps
- Decide whether to adjust `test_env_smoke.py` (add minimal `TaskSampler`) or to simplify and test `OrbitEnv` directly.
- Silence matplotlib warnings by forcing non-interactive backend (`Agg`) inside tests.
- Begin gradual shift: focus on refining documentation (`README.md`), writing clear commit messages, and stabilizing the test suite.
