## Title: Orbit Lost. Mind in Storm. The Day I Almost Gave Up.

### Context
Today marks Day 14 of the spacecraft AI control project.  
By now, I was supposed to be running a trained PPO controller that generates smooth, intelligent orbits.  
But instead?  
The trajectory generated by `evaluate_ppo_orbit.py` is still empty.

I've debugged model loading, state tensor shapes, action sampling, thrust visualization...  
I rewrote key parts of the loop, visualizer, and action pipeline multiple times.  
It wasn't just two hours of effort today.  
By my count, it's been over six hours of continuous work — run, crash, repeat.

And the truth is:  
Ever since I started the PPO phase, most of the code was generated by ChatGPT,  
And I sometimes feel like I’m just debugging someone else’s black box.

### Emotional Crash
This wasn’t my first fight with an AI controller.  
But this time, something cracked.  
Not because of a coding error, but because of this thought:  
“If most of the code isn’t mine…  
If I’m just running, adjusting, reacting…  
Am I really learning anything?  
Am I really building this project?”

It felt like I wasn’t in control of the spacecraft,  
I was just pressing the launch button over and over again.

### My Realization
But that frustration revealed something important:  
I care. That’s why I’m angry.  
If I didn’t care, I wouldn’t feel so defeated.  
If this didn’t matter, I wouldn’t still be here, hours later, refusing to let it go.

Yes — I’ve relied heavily on GPT to generate code during PPO development.  
But:  
I’m the one setting up the simulation.  
I’m the one connecting the model.  
I’m the one interpreting every empty plot and silent failure.  

Even if today’s trajectory is blank,  
The learning trajectory is still orbiting inside me.

### What I Actually Did Today
- Submitted all updated files  
- Wrote this side-log to honestly capture the mental/emotional struggle  
- Preserved failed experiments instead of deleting them — because they’re part of the process  
- Decided to keep building this project, even if progress is just 1% a day  

### Final Words
Maybe today, the AI can’t control the spacecraft.  
But I know myself — I’m still on course.  
Off by a few degrees? Maybe.  
But this mission… is still in flight.
