# Project Log – Day 27

## Date
2025-08-11

## Context
Today’s focus was on **upgrading the PPO training pipeline** to be compatible with the **latest Gymnasium API**, while keeping all core training logic from the previous PPO implementation.

The environment interface was updated for:
- `reset()` now returning `(obs, info)`
- `step()` now returning `(obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info)`
- Full handling of `done` logic via `done = terminated or truncated`

This was aimed to ensure **forward compatibility** with future Gym versions and reduce deprecation warnings.

## Work Done
1. **Refactored `ppo.py`**  
   - Merged existing PPO logic into a **single, fully updated script** that works directly with the Gymnasium API.
   - Adjusted `env.reset()` and `env.step()` calls to unpack `(obs, info)` and `(obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info)` respectively.
   - Unified the observation normalization function.
   - Preserved device auto-selection (`cuda` if available).
   - Maintained compatibility with the existing `OrbitEnv` setup.

2. **Integration Improvements**
   - Verified that the code can still import and run with the custom `OrbitEnv` environment.
   - Ensured training loop still tracks rewards, KL divergence, and adapts `TRAIN_ITERS`.
   - Added clean `done` handling to avoid accidental infinite loops.

3. **Testing**
   - Ran the updated PPO script for initial epochs to ensure there were no breaking changes in:
     - Reward logging
     - KL adaptation
     - Environment reset/termination

## Issues Encountered
- Needed to carefully adjust `done` handling to match the **terminated/truncated** split in Gymnasium.
- Initially forgot to unpack `info` in `reset()` — fixed after first run error.
- Minor reward logging mismatch when adapting to the new API (solved by reusing previous `evaluate_policy` logic).

## Current Status
- **PPO script now fully Gymnasium-compatible**.
- Environment loads and runs without warnings.
- Ready for further PPO fine-tuning or integration with **Expert Init** and **Hybrid imitation + PPO** pipelines.

## Files Updated
- `ppo.py` – full new unified Gymnasium-compatible PPO script

## Next Steps (Optional)
- Begin training with the updated PPO script using V6.1-Hybrid initialization.
- Compare performance curves with the old PPO version to check for any regression.
- Add additional logging for `terminated` vs `truncated` cases for debugging.
