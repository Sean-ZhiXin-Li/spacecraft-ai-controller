# Project Log — Day 40

## Focus
Documentation and consolidation of the project into a structured **README.md**, summarizing the past 39 days of progress and preparing the repository for public/research use.

---

## What Was Done
1. **Drafted and finalized a comprehensive `README.md`:**
   - Added project overview, repository structure, and installation guide.
   - Provided quick-start instructions for running baselines (`day39_quickrun.py`).
   - Inserted placeholder figures for baseline results, training curves, and example trajectories.
   - Integrated the full **Project History timeline (Day 1–39)** to document development.

2. **Dependency clarification:**
   - Listed Python requirements: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `torch`, `scikit-learn`, `gymnasium`.
   - Confirmed standard library usage (`os`, `json`, `glob`, `random`, `dataclasses`, `typing`).

3. **Output:**
   - Generated `README.md` file under project root.
   - Ensured Markdown formatting is copy-paste ready for GitHub.

## Observations
- Writing the README provided a natural checkpoint:  
  - Phase 1–5 history is now archived in a reproducible format.  
  - Repository has a clear structure and entry points for external users.  
- Documentation highlighted the strong baseline pipeline (Zero / Greedy / Expert), and made it easier to showcase next-phase research goals (Hybrid RL + curriculum).

## Next Steps
- Insert final figures into the README (baseline comparisons, PPO reward curves, trajectories).  
- Generate a `requirements.txt` to simplify environment setup.  
- Begin **Phase 2 experiments**: Hybrid Imitation+PPO and curriculum training for eccentric orbits.

## Artifacts
- `README.md` (root directory)
