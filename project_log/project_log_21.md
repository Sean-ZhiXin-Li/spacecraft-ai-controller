# Day 21 – Long Training Session for V6 Imitation Model

 Date: 2025-08-05  
 Task: Launch long-duration training for V6  
 Model: ImitationController V6 using MLPRegressor (Scikit-Learn)  
 Training Time: > 9 hours and still running  
 Dataset: All 30 expert_dataset_*.npy files

## Work Summary

Today I ran a full-scale training session of Imitation Controller V6.

- Loaded **30** expert datasets
- Combined all data into a single training set
- Added extra physical features: radius `r`, speed `v`, angle `cos(θ)`
- Scaled input features with `StandardScaler`
- Initialized `MLPRegressor` with:
  - `hidden_layer_sizes=(128, 64)`
  - `activation='tanh'`
  - `max_iter=3000`, `early_stopping=True`
- Training started around **1 PM** and continued past **10 PM**

## Observations

- Model is progressing very slowly — only **7 iterations in 9 hours**
- No crash or error reported, so training is left running overnight
- Cause of slowness may be large dataset size + high model complexity + `tanh` activation
- Decided to leave training untouched to observe full convergence

## Pending Tasks

- [ ] Wait for training to complete
- [ ] Evaluate V6 model on test data
- [ ] Save results: `imitation_policy_model_V6.joblib`, `state_scaler_V6.joblib`
- [ ] Run closed-loop simulation with V6 controller
- [ ] Compare trajectory vs V5
- [ ] Analyze orbit error

## Reflection

This is the longest training session so far. It might not be efficient — but it proves my patience. Let's see what this long haul gives me.
